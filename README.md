# Movie Length Visualization

This repo is for creating a visualization modeling how
the length of shows have changed over time. This
visualization is for Cornell's INFO 3300 class.

## Dataset Information

We are currently using two datasets in this
visualization: [NetFlix Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows),
and [HBO Movies and TV Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgoenrique/hbo-max-movies-and-tv-shows/data?select=titles.csv).
Both datasets are from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Usage

To use the visualization, download the files, and navigate
to the directory with `index.html`. Start a server using Python
with the command `python -m http.server`. The server should be
open on `localhost:8000`. Type `localhost:8000` into your
browser to view the output.

## Cloning Information

If you are a student taking INFO 3300 at Cornell
University, **DO NOT** clone this project and try to
pass it off as your own. To do so is a violation of
Cornell's Academic Integrity policy. No one should be
stealing this project and passing it off as their own anyway.
